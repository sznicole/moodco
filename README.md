# MOODCO
This is my first project with Next.js and Hono made to track moods! It was my first time using frameworks, so the site is very minimal, but it was a fun experience designing my own API and learning to connect my frontend and backend. NOTE: When the user clicks a mood, it does log into the backend memory array, but the history function needs to be implemented. I wasn't too sure on how to use useEffect and useState from React, so I didn't want to include it before I fully understood it.
