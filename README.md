# MOODCO
This is my first project with Next.js and Hono made to track moods! It was my first time using frameworks, so the site is very minimal, but it was a fun experience designing my own API and learning to connect my frontend and backend. When the user clicks a mood, it does log into a backend memory array, but the history needs to be implemented.
